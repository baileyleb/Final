/*Create a dice game where a user plays against the computer. The user and the computer each 
roll a pair of dice 3 times. After the third roll of the dice the player with highest score wins. 
The scoring for the game works as follows: 
- If any of the players two dice comes up as a 1 then the score for that round for the player 
is 0. eg: if the player rolls a 6 and 1, they get a score of 0 
- If the player rolls a pair of the same numbers then the players score is the total of the 
two dice times 2. eg: if he player rolls 5 and 5, they get a score of (5+5)*2=20 
- If the player rolls any other combination of dice other than the ones mentioned above 
then the players score is the total value of the two dice, eg: player rolls a 3 and 2, player 
gets a score of 3+2=5 
The game should provide a text or graphical output showing the following: 
- The current rolled dice values for the player and the computer. 
- The score for this round for the player and the computer. 
- The accumulated total score for the player and computer 
The game should provide a button that will do the following: roll a pair dice for the player and 
another pair of dice for the computer, calculate the score for each of the playerâ€™s then update 
the browser display to reflect the state of the game. 
After three rolls of the dice the game should total up the scores and display a message 
displaying who the winner was.  
The game should provide a button that will reset the game and start a new game */
